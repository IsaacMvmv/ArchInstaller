# ArchInstaller
My personal cool arch installer
Currently it supports ES/EN/FR/NL (Languages)

# Requirements:
An arch-based os as host


# HOW TO USE:

```
sh install.sh /dev/sdX
```
X is a, b, c, etc...

You can know the letter using:

```
fdisk -l
```

# WHY THIS SCRIPT
This script creates an universal operative system (Can be booted in almost all PCs, only requirement is 1gb ram and x86_64 (Blur and graph will be really lag on low-end devices)


If you want this in your usb/hdd, just run this ;D
